It does a very thorough deep dive into JS.\nThe author is really good, and I like that the individual books are small and approachable. It does get a bit opinionated at times.</p>\n<h3>Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja</h3>\n<p>Amazon: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-JavaScript-Ninja-John-Resig/dp/1617292850\">http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-JavaScript-Ninja-John-Resig/dp/1617292850</a></p>\n<p>From the author of JQuery. Very readable, solid examples. Goes deep.</p>\n<h3>Eloquent JavaScript</h3>\n<p>Amazon: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-JavaScript-Modern-Introduction-Programming/dp/1593275846\">http://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-JavaScript-Modern-Introduction-Programming/dp/1593275846</a></p>\n<p>Free Online: <a href=\"http://eloquentjavascript.net/\">http://eloquentjavascript.net/</a></p>\n<p>One of the best introductions to programming/JS I’ve read. Very well put together and the online version has runnable examples.\nI haven’t made it all the way through this one, but my impression is that introductory chapters are the most valuable</p>\n<h3>Mostly adequate guide to Functional Programming (in javascript)</h3>\n<p>Free Online: <a href=\"https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide\">https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide</a></p>\n<p>This book isn’t really for beginners. I’ve been tackling this just a little bit at a time for the last 6 months or so.\nIf you want to learn functional programming in JS, this is the best guide I know of.</p>\n<h3>Clean Code (NOT JS specific)</h3>\n<p>Amazon: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882\">http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882</a></p>\n<p>I always recommend this (non-JS-specific) one to people too — definitely the most influential book to my programming style that I’ve read. Might not be super helpful in actually getting a job, but it will definitely make you better at it once you get one.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 01, 2016","path":"/2016-05-01-books-for-a-js-developer","title":"Books for a JavaScript developer"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
