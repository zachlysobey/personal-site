After over a year of lazily working on this website, I've replaced the old WordPress blog I had at <a href=\"http://zach.lysobey.com\">http://zach.lysobey.com</a>.

I did not properly set up the DNS config with my DNS provider, and zach.lysobey.com was still pointing at a (broken) copy of the old WordPress site. In the meantime, I'd configured GitHub to point <em>this site</em> my domain, so the GH pages link was totally broken in the interim.</p>\n<p>Luckily (?), this site gets no traffic, makes no uptime guarantees, and no one cares if its down (except me). So I was able to just ignore it being horribly broken until I had the energy to make a call to my DNS Provider (1&#x26;1). It turns out, the problem was simple. I'd created a CNAME record for my subdomain, but I still had a A-record pointing at the old web-host. And now we're back in business!</p>\n<p><em>If you're curious, see a bit more info on the <a href=\"https://github.com/zachlysobey/personal-site/issues/12\">GitHub Issue I used to track this effort</a>.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"embarassing-content-live-now\"><a href=\"#embarassing-content-live-now\" aria-label=\"embarassing content live now permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Embarassing content live now?</h2>\n<p>One of the reasons I was avoiding publishing this site on my proper domain, is I've been considering it a work-in-progress and leaving some unfinished, and even slightly embarassing content lying about.
