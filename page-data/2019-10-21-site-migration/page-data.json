After over a year of lazily working on this website, I've replaced the old WordPress blog I had at <a href=\"http://zach.lysobey.com\">http://zach.lysobey.com</a>. It was previously only available via a github.io github pages URL.</p>\n<p>I've <em>archived</em> the old site at <a href=\"http://old.zach.lysobey.com\">http://old.zach.lysobey.com</a>.</p>\n<h2>Stumbling blocks</h2>\n<p>Not that I'm sure anyone has noticed, but I actually totally broke this page for a few days. I did not properly set up the DNS config with my DNS provider, and zach.lysobey.com was still pointing at a (broken) copy of the old WordPress site. In the meantime, I'd configured GitHub to point <em>this site</em> my domain, so the GH pages link was totally broken in the interim.</p>\n<p>Luckily (?), this site gets no traffic, makes no uptime guarantees, and no one cares if its down (except me). So I was able to just ignore it being horribly broken until I had the energy to make a call to my DNS Provider (1&#x26;1). It turns out, the problem was simple. I'd created a CNAME record for my subdomain, but I still had a A-record pointing at the old web-host. And now we're back in business!</p>\n<p><em>If you're curious, see a bit more info on the <a href=\"https://github.com/zachlysobey/personal-site/issues/12\">GitHub Issue I used to track this effort</a>.</em></p>\n<h2>Embarassing content live now?</h2>\n<p>One of the reasons I was avoiding publishing this site on my proper domain, is I've been considering it a work-in-progress and leaving some unfinished, and even slightly embarassing content lying about. (I'm looking at <em>you</em> <a href=\"http://zach.lysobey.com/music\">zach.lysobey.com/music</a>).</p>\n<p>But I've decided to exercise a bit of an IDGAF mentality here. Its never going to be <em>good enough</em> so I might as well just get something out there. </p>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 21, 2019","path":"/2019-10-21-site-migration","title":"Ship it!
