Cha-ching!</p>\n<p>I set my rate at $5/:15 ($20/hr), and had 5 such sessions. There have\nbeen a few false starts, and a couple times I've given a bit of my time away for free\n(you can pause the clock). So I'm definitely not making my full-time NYC developer salary doing this.</p>\n<p>In these 1:1 sessions I've done the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>setting up hot-module-reloading for a react/electron project</li>\n<li>working through SQL homework problem</li>\n<li>debugging a confusing TypeScript scenario where types weren't <em>narrowing</em> as expected</li>\n<li>adding functionality to a table build with the jQuery <em>data-table</em> plugin</li>\n<li>resolving a git merge issue</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"freelance-work\"><a href=\"#freelance-work\" aria-label=\"freelance work permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>\"Freelance\" work</h2>\n<p>Somewhat more lucrative, I also got a Freelance job for $80. There was a request to create\na CLI to call into some APIs to get data on foot-races and runner's results and output\n<code class=\"language-text\">.csv</code> files. The person who requested this tool wants to use it to play with some data\nvisualization stuff with D3. I completed this project in maybe 3-4 hours of total effort\n(and probably over-engineered it because I was having so much fun).</p>\n<h2 id=\"would-i-be-able-to-support-myself-using-income-from-codementor\"><a href=\"#would-i-be-able-to-support-myself-using-income-from-codementor\" aria-label=\"would i be able to support myself using income from codementor permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Would I be able to support myself using income from Codementor?</h2>\n<p>And keep my New York City apartment? Probably not.</p>\n<p>I figure if I really engaged this platform full-time, I could probably get to a place where\nI am consistantly making $100/day. That's pretty cool. I could totally move somewhere (perhaps a tropical island)\nand as long as there was good internet access, and reasonable cost-of-living, I'd be doing pretty well.</p>\n<p>I don't think I'm likely going to do that, but its nice to know I could supplement my income a bit.\nI'm still in the job market, and the savings are drying up quicker than I'd like, but this makes me feel\na lot more comfortable taking my time and not rushing to accept an offer somewhere I'm not very excited to work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"criticisms-of-the-platform\"><a href=\"#criticisms-of-the-platform\" aria-label=\"criticisms of the platform permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Criticisms of the platform</h2>\n<p>I think its awesome that codementor exists, and I'm going to probably continue using it. But I can't help but be a\nlittle critical. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The UI is frequently unintuitive, and things don't always work smoothly.</li>\n<li>Notifications are inconsistent. Its easy to miss them, and sometimes if you dismiss them, they come back</li>\n<li>The mobile app is pretty bad</li>\n<li>Once you start a job, you apparently lose all the chat messages you had with the requesting user on the original job. The original post seems to disappear as well.</li>\n<li>A few times, after a session was over, I was stuck in an \"in session\" status which prevented me from starting new jobs.</li>\n<li>Codementor's cut is pretty big. Its 21% but can drop to as low as 13% after you complete enough jobs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts\" aria-label=\"final thoughts permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Again, I'm pretty stoked about this. Its been a lot of fun so far.</p>\n<p>I intend to spend some time exploring other similar platforms. I think <em>fiverr</em> is similar, and I looked at ELance and Odesk back in the day (and had poor experiences there). But as far as I know those platforms do not have the mentorship angle, which is kinda the coolest bit to me here. I have fun working with other developers and pairing to complete tasks.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"November 05, 2019","path":"/2019-11-05-exploring-codementor","title":"Exploring Codementor","tags":["programming","mentorship"],"youtube":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
