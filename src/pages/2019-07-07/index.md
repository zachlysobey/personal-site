It's been a couple weeks since I started this project, and haven't really gone back to it since. But here I am!

Last time, I went through half of the ["Zero to DApp"](https://docs.blockstack.org/develop/zero_to_dapp_1.html) blockstack tutorial. I guess it follows that I should continue down that path.

While I haven't done any work on this since last post, I have done a bit more thinking about what I'd like to build. I really like the idea of having a personal, and configurable app for generating content and storing it in [Gaia](https://github.com/blockstack/gaia) (Blockstack's decentralized storage system somewhat analogous to Amazon S3). This "content" would be a variety of different *shapes*. I'm thinking I'll start with microblog-style status updates, and perhaps move to photos and such. I'll try to bear these modest goals in mind while going through the rest of the tuturial.
