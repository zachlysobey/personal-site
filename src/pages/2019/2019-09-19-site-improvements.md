Today I spent a little time to give this site a little facelift. Most importantly I restructured the site so that all my posts show up at the home page, and removed the *blog* page. I also prettied it up a bit.

### The commits:

* [`409f8b7` (display) add shadow to my name](https://github.com/zachlysobey/personal-site/commit/409f8b7)
* [`92b13ff` (display) remove blog page](https://github.com/zachlysobey/personal-site/commit/92b13ff)
* [`f9c37e9` (display) start re-structuring the site](https://github.com/zachlysobey/personal-site/commit/f9c37e9)
* [`922986b` (metadata) add tags to posts](https://github.com/zachlysobey/personal-site/commit/922986b)
* [`fc0d7a2` (content) remove 'second post' with no real content](https://github.com/zachlysobey/personal-site/commit/fc0d7a2)

### What's next?

I added *tags* this time around, but they aren't really used yet. I'd like to leverage these on the *music* and *programming* pages to show relevant posts there. But I'd also like to be able to view/search all my posts filtered by one or more tags. Either that or I might figure out how best to add images (or other content types) to the post previews, which should make this all look a little more slick.
