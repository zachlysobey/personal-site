I've been taking some guitar lessons.
Finally trying to learn some stuff like the circle of fifths.
My homework this week was to write some chord progressions in C major.
This is the first one that sorta feels like it could be a song.
It's a little rough and needs some practice, but maybe worth sharing?
Over the coming weeks I'll be working my way around the circle of fifths,
writing little progressions in each.
